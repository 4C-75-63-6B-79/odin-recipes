        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Using pantry items plus a couple of fresh items, you can create a cheesy, comforting casserole 
            your whole family will love. Though it does include RO*TEL® and a can of mild green chile 
            peppers, it's not spicy, but if you like the heat, choose hot RO*TEL® and peppers. This 
            pantry chicken casserole reheats well, too, but I had to hide it, or there would have been 
            no night #2! A crusty bread and a green salad complete this easy pantry meal.

            <li>1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 (8 ounce) packages processed cheese food, cubed</li>
            <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained</li>
            <li>1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes and green chilies, undrained</li>
            <li>1 pound fresh tomatillos, husks removed, halved</li>
            <li>1 (4 ounce) can mild chopped green chile peppers</li>
            <li>4 cups cooked chicken, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
                Spray a large casserole dish with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring 
                occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain.
            </li>
            <li>While the pasta is cooking, melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and bell 
                pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Add 
                mushrooms and cook until they release their liquid, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook, 
                stirring occasionally, until fragrant, about 1 minute.
            </li>
            <li>Stir in processed cheese food, diced tomatoes and juice, diced tomatoes and green chiles 
                with juice, and mild chile peppers. Cook and stir until cheese has melted, 5 to 10 
                minutes. Remove from heat and stir in cooked pasta and chicken. Pour into the prepared 
                baking dish.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 20 minutes. Serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
