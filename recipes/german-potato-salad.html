        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a different potato salad for those who don't want a mayonnaise-based recipe. My family
            has enjoyed this for many years, and it is easy to adapt by adding more spices that suit your
            family.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 white potatoes, peeled and cut into cubes</li>
            <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dry mustard</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ cup cider vinegar, divided</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
            <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil.
                Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until just tender, about 15 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Put potatoes into a large bowl; add onions and stir.</li>
            <li>Mix sugar, mustard, and salt together in a bowl. Stir just enough vinegar into sugar mixture
                to form a paste; season with black pepper.
            </li>
            <li>Whisk remaining vinegar and vegetable oil together in a separate bowl until smooth; stream into
                bowl with the paste, whisking continually to incorporate. Pour the dressing over the potato and onion 
                mixture.
            </li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let salad cool slightly, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
